## ASSISTANT
In Go, build constraints are special comments that can be used to control which source files are included in the build, based on the target operating system, architecture, or other build tags. These constraints allow you to write code that is specific to certain platforms, while ignoring or excluding code that is not relevant to those platforms.

Here's an example of build constraints in Go:

```go
//go:build !windows

package main

func message() string {
	return "Hello, non-Windows!"
}
```

In this example, the build constraint `// +build linux` tells the Go compiler to include this source file only when building for Linux. If you try to build this code on a different operating system, the compiler will ignore this file.

You can use multiple build constraints to include or exclude files based on multiple criteria. For example:

```go
// +build linux,amd64 darwin

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Linux/AMD64 or Darwin!")
}
```

In this example, the build constraint `// +build linux,amd64 darwin` includes this file only when building for Linux on an AMD64 architecture, or for Darwin (which is the operating system used by macOS).

You can also use negation (`!`) to exclude files from the build based on certain criteria. For example:

```go
// +build !windows

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, non-Windows!")
}
```

In this example, the build constraint `// +build !windows` excludes this file when building for Windows, but includes it for all other platforms.
