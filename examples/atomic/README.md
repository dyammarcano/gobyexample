# Atomic package explain code

This example shows how to use the atomic package to explain the code.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
	"sync/atomic"
)

type ServerConn struct {
	Connection net.Conn
	ID         string
	Open       bool
}

func main() {
	p := atomic.Pointer[ServerConn]{}
	s := ServerConn{ID: "first_conn"}
	p.Store(&s)
	fmt.Println(p.Load()) // Will display value stored.
}
```

This code defines a struct type ServerConn, which contains a net.Conn field named Connection, an ID field of type string, and a bool field named Open.

The main function initializes an atomic.Pointer to a ServerConn struct type. The atomic.Pointer is a struct provided by the Go sync/atomic package that provides atomic operations on pointers. In this case, the Pointer is used to store and retrieve a pointer to a ServerConn value.

The code then initializes a ServerConn value named s with an ID of "first_conn". This ServerConn value is then stored in the atomic.Pointer using the Store method. The Store method atomically replaces the value pointed to by the Pointer with the ServerConn value &s.

Finally, the code retrieves the value stored in the atomic.Pointer using the Load method and prints it to the console using fmt.Println(). The Load method atomically retrieves the value pointed to by the Pointer and returns it as a pointer to a ServerConn value. In this case, it retrieves the pointer to s, which was stored in the Pointer earlier. The output of the fmt.Println() statement will display the value stored in p, which is a pointer to the ServerConn value &s.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the atomic.Pointer type in Go to store and retrieve pointers to data structures atomically.
